# Shell V2

## **WARNING:** This project is currently in progress!
### Please come back on January 12, 2021 to see the final product!

---

## Overview

`shell` is a UNIX command interpreter. It is a replica of the `sh` shell, built from scratch in C. This project was developed as part of the Holberton School Low Level Systems specialization and is the second, more advanced version of the [simple shell project](https://github.com/jicruz96/JISH_A-Custom-Shell-Terminal) completed in the Foundations year.

This project was written by J.I. Cruz and Gabriel Abdul-Raheem.

## Installation üõ†

### Requirements
* Linux - gcc (>= 4.8.4)

Clone this repository to your local system. Use the following to compile the program and save the executable into a file named `shell`:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o shell
```

## Usage 

* **Run the executable file (  `./shell`   ). Use the shell. *That's it!***
* Type `exit` or `Ctrl-D` to exit `shell`. 

### Non-interactive mode

You can also use `shell` non-interactively. Use `echo` to pipe in a command to `shell`. The program will execute the inputted command(s) without re-prompting.
```
$ echo "ls" | ./shell
```

## ‚ú® Features ‚ú®

`shell` can run any executables in the PATH. The following built-in commands are also available:

| Built-in | Use |
|-|-|
| `exit [status]` |	Exit shell with specified exit status |
| `env`	| Print list of current environment variables |
| `setenv` | Set an environment variable |
| `unsetenv` | Unset an environment variable |
| `cd` | Change directories |
| `history` | Print command history |
| `help` | Display help for builtin commands |
| `alias [ALIAS='COMMAND']` | Alias a command as another. If no alias is given, print all aliases |
